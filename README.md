# Automated Pixelisation and Image Manipulation

## Description

Automated Pixelisation and Image Manipulation is a mini project that utilizes Node.js and the "sharp" library to pixelate images. The project takes images from the "images" folder and converts them into their respective pixelated versions, saving the results in the "images-output" folder.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, follow these steps to run the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory using the command line or terminal.

```bash
cd automated-pixelisation-and-image-manipulation
```

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will trigger the image pixelation process. The script will take all the images present in the "images" folder and generate their pixelated versions, saving them in the "images-output" folder.

## Use Cases

### 1. Image Processing Automation

The project provides a basic foundation for automating image processing tasks using the "sharp" library. With a few modifications, you can expand the project to perform various other image manipulation tasks such as resizing, cropping, rotating, and applying filters. By customizing the script and adding additional functionalities, you can build a more comprehensive image processing pipeline.

### 2. Batch Processing of Images

If you have a large number of images that require pixelation or any other form of image manipulation, this project can serve as a starting point. You can easily extend the script to handle batch processing, allowing you to apply pixelation or other transformations to multiple images at once.

### 3. Image Filtering and Effects

The "sharp" library offers a wide range of image processing capabilities beyond pixelation. You can explore various image filters, color adjustments, and effects that can be applied to images to achieve different artistic or visual effects. This project can be a stepping stone to create an image filter library or an image manipulation tool with a user-friendly interface.

### 4. Image Analysis and Computer Vision

The pixelation process can also be seen as a rudimentary form of image analysis and anonymization. In a more advanced use case, you could build upon this project to create a system for anonymizing sensitive images or hiding specific regions in images while preserving privacy.

## Requirements

The project requires Node.js to be installed on your system. Additionally, the following dependency is used:

- [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp): "^0.32.0"

The "sharp" library is used for image processing, including pixelation in this case. It is already included as a dependency in the "package.json" file, so there is no need to install it separately.

## Folder Structure

The project follows the following folder structure:

```
automated-pixelisation-and-image-manipulation/
|-- images/
|   |-- image1.jpg
|   |-- image2.png
|-- images-output/
|   |-- pixelated_image1.jpg
|   |-- pixelated_image2.png
|-- package.json
|-- package-lock.json
|-- pixelate.js
|-- README.md
```

- `images/`: This folder contains the input images you want to pixelate.
- `images-output/`: This folder will be created automatically to store the pixelated versions of the images.
- `package.json`: This file contains the project metadata and the list of dependencies.
- `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated and used by npm to manage the project's dependencies and versions.
- `pixelate.js`: This is the main script that handles the image pixelation process.
- `README.md`: This file provides information about the project and how to run it.
